# @box2d/benchmark

A benchmark to compare various js/ts Box2D implementations.

Try it here: https://lusito.github.io/box2d.ts/

**Fair Warning:** In theory this can be added as a dependency to other physics libraries in order to run benchmarks against local code. But this has not been tested yet.

## The @box2d Ecosystem

@box2d is a full-blown ecosystem for box2d for the JavaScript/TypeScript world. It can be used both in the browser and in node.js

Check out demos and compare performance here: https://lusito.github.io/box2d.ts/

**Fair Warning:** The whole @box2d ecosystem is in an early stage, so it will probably change a lot before we release the first stable version (1.0.0).

Other packages included in the ecosystem:

-   Benchmark: Based on [bench2d](https://github.com/joelgwebber/bench2d) by joelgwebber
-   Controllers: From the LiquidFun project
-   Particles: Also from the LiquidFun project
-   Lights: [ported from LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights)
-   DebugDraw: Debug drawing using a canvas
