# @box2d/controllers

Controllers for @box2d/core

@box2d/controllers is a TypeScript port of Googles [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun) controllers.
This is a fork of [box2d.ts](https://github.com/flyover/box2d.ts) from Isaac Burns (flyover) who did a huge job initially porting Box2D and [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun) to TypeScript.

## The @box2d Ecosystem

@box2d is a full-blown ecosystem for box2d for the JavaScript/TypeScript world. It can be used both in the browser and in node.js

Check out demos and compare performance here: https://lusito.github.io/box2d.ts/

**Fair Warning:** The whole @box2d ecosystem is in an early stage, so it will probably change a lot before we release the first stable version (1.0.0).

Other packages included in the ecosystem:
- Benchmark: Based on [bench2d](https://github.com/joelgwebber/bench2d) by joelgwebber
- Controllers: From the LiquidFun project
- Particles: Also from the LiquidFun project
- Lights: [ported from LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/box2dlights)
- DebugDraw: Debug drawing using a canvas
